# mern-books

The Book Search Engine relies on Google Books API data to supply data for this application, in which users can save searched books to a list.

This project entailed refactoring its internal API to use GraphQL. The traditional REST API endpoints were replaced with an Apollo Server to handle requests more flexibly. As the front end is a React app, I relied on the graphql-tag and @apollo/react-hooks packages to power the app.
